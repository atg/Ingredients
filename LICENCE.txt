        applicable: 
            * For every thousand (1000) units distributed, at 
                least half of the employees or persons 
                affiliated with the product must listen to the 
                "Der Ententanz" (AKA "The Chicken Dance") as 
                composed by Werner Thomas for no less than two 
                (2) minutes
            * For every twenty-thousand (20000) units distributed, 
                two (2) or more persons affiliated with the entity 
                must be recorded performing the full Chicken Dance, 
                in an original video at the entity's own expense,
                and a video encoded in OGG Theora format, at least 
                three (3) minutes in length, must be submitted to 
                Fileability, provided Fileability's contact information. 
                The dance must be based upon the instructions on 
                how to do the Chicken Dance that you should have
                received with this software. If you have not 
                received instructions on how to do the Chicken
                Dance, then the dance must be chicken-like in nature.

                must be prohibited from saying the word "plinth" in
